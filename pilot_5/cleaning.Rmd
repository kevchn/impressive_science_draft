```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)     # create plots with ggplot, manipulate data, etc.
library(broom.mixed)   # convert regression models into nice tables
library(modelsummary)  # combine multiple regression models into a single table
library(lme4)          # model specification / estimation 
library(lmerTest)      # provides p-values in the output

```

## Import data
```{r import, message=FALSE}
d <- read_csv("./data/qualtrics.csv")
names(d)
```

```{r}
# inspect
head(d) # you can also use View(d)
# delete first two rows
d <- d %>% 
  slice(3: nrow(.)) 
```

## Attention check
```{r attention}
# attention check
# to see different answers given (i.e.levels), transform into factor
d$attention <- as.factor(d$attention)
# check levels to see different answer types
levels(d$attention) 

table(d$attention)
```

There is no failed attention check. 

```{r}
# filter to only valid attention check responses
d <- d %>% filter(str_detect(attention, regex("attention", ignore_case = TRUE)))
```

## Re-shape data

```{r}
# check all names and their order
names(d)
```


```{r}
# clean and re-shape
d <- d %>% 
  # add an easy to read participant identifier
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  # rename variable indicating which question has been used
  rename(version = discipline) %>% 
  # bring to long format
  pivot_longer(cols = c(starts_with("archeo"), starts_with("entom")), 
               names_to = "condition", values_to = "score") %>% 
  # separate conditions into CONVERGENCE_OUTCOME_STIMULUS
  separate_wider_delim(condition, "_", names = c("discipline", "outcome")
                       ) %>%
  # necessary because of the way we labeled
  drop_na(score) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome, values_from = score) %>% 
  # create better variable names
  rename(competence = comp, 
         impressed = imp) %>% 
  # all variables are coded as `character` - make key variables numeric
  mutate(across(c(learn, competence, impressed, trust, starts_with("knowledge")), as.numeric),
         # recode knowledge questions as TRUE and FALSE, such that 1 corresponds to TRUE and 0 to FALSE
         across(starts_with("knowledge"), ~ifelse(.x == 1, TRUE, FALSE))
         )
```

Calculate an average knowledge score and number of correctly answered questions per participant. 

```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  # add average knowledge score
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    n_correct = sum(c_across(starts_with("knowledge")),na.rm = TRUE),
    knowledge_avg = mean(c_across(starts_with("knowledge")),na.rm = TRUE),
         ) 
```


## Export data

```{r}
write_csv(d, "data/cleaned.csv")
```
