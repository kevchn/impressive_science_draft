```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)     # create plots with ggplot, manipulate data, etc.
library(broom.mixed)   # convert regression models into nice tables
library(modelsummary)  # combine multiple regression models into a single table
library(lme4)          # model specification / estimation 
library(lmerTest)      # provides p-values in the output
library(ggpubr)        # stile feature of ggplot
library(gghalves)      # do special plots in ggplot

```

## Import data
```{r import, message=FALSE}
d <- read_csv("./data/qualtrics.csv")
names(d)
```

```{r}
# inspect
head(d) # you can also use View(d)
# delete first two rows
d <- d %>% 
  slice(3: nrow(.)) 
```

## Attention check
```{r attention}
# attention check
# to see different answers given (i.e.levels), transform into factor
d$attention <- as.factor(d$attention)
# check levels to see different answer types
levels(d$attention) 

# We filter out two participants 
table(d$attention)
```

There is no failed attention check that we remove. 

```{r}
# filter to only valid attention check responses
d <- d %>% filter(str_detect(attention, "attention"))
```

## Re-shape data

```{r}
# check all names and their order
names(d)
```


```{r}
# clean and re-shape
d <- d %>% 
  # add an easy to read participant identifier
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  # bring to long format
  pivot_longer(cols = c(starts_with("archeo"), starts_with("entom")), 
               names_to = "condition", values_to = "score") %>% 
  # Re-code values for condition variable:
  # Remove everything after the three dots and the three dots themselves
  mutate(condition = str_replace(condition, "\\.{3}.*", "")) %>% 
  # separate conditions into CONVERGENCE_OUTCOME_STIMULUS
  separate_wider_delim(condition, "_", names = c("discipline", "impressiveness", 
                                                 "outcome")
                       ) %>%
  drop_na(score) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome, values_from = score) %>% 
  # create better variable names
  rename(competence = comp, 
         impressed = impress) %>% 
  # all variables are coded as `character` - make key variables numeric
  mutate(across(c(learn, competence, impressed, trust), as.numeric)
         )
```

## Export data

```{r}
write_csv(d, "data/cleaned.csv")
```
